# Modpack Patch Notes: Version 2.0.0
**Release Date**: January, 2025

# **Welcome to the Long-Awaited 2.0 Update for Create - Forge Frontier!**

After months of dedicated development starting in April 2024, the time has finally come to unveil this transformative update. Forge Frontier 2.0 is a comprehensive overhaul that takes the pack to new heights, redefining its identity as a Create-focused modpack rather than simply a modpack that includes Create. Let’s dive into the highlights of this monumental release.

## **Revamped Interface & Branding**
The main menu, loading screens, and settings have been completely redesigned to reflect the updated name and vision of **Create - Forge Frontier**, previously known as *Landscapes Reimagined: Forge Frontier*. This refreshed look sets the tone for an elevated gameplay experience.

## **Massive Mod Changes**
- **New Additions**: A wide array of mods have been added to enhance creativity, exploration, and automation.
- **Refined Mod List**: Older mods that no longer aligned with the Create-focused vision have been removed, ensuring a more cohesive experience.
- **Custom Content**: Expect an abundance of new recipes, blocks, items, and mechanics tailored specifically for this update.

## **Overhauled World Generation**
The world itself has been reimagined, with **Tectonic** replacing Biomes O' Plenty for more dynamic terrain generation. All dimensions have been enhanced, including:  
- **The Overworld**: Featuring new structures, revamped vanilla structures, and custom Integrated Dungeons & Villages. Gone are the basic vanilla villages, replaced with more immersive alternatives. Villager AI and trades have also been significantly upgraded for a deeper experience.  
- **The Nether**: Now using **Nether Remastered**, with custom changes to lock progression, making the journey into the Nether both challenging and rewarding.  
- **The End**: **End Remastered** has been completely customized for Forge Frontier. Progression to access the End is now a thrilling journey, culminating in an epic Dragon fight with increased difficulty. This unlocks "End Game" progression, including the creation of a custom Forge Rocket that leads to a future planned endgame planet with its own unique boss.  
- **Ad Astra Planets**: Explore six newly added custom planets, featuring all of Alex's Cave Biomes, along with improved structure generation across the universe.

## **Enhanced Progression Systems**
- **Ad Astra Rockets**: The rocket progression system has been overhauled, introducing higher-tier rockets and a more rewarding sense of advancement with each tier.  
- **Resource Automation**: Discover **Molten Vents** in specific biomes and dimensions, a new mechanic for resource generation. These vents also introduce **Stone Ore variants**, like Ochrum from Create, that can only be accessed through this system, making resource processing a more rewarding challenge.

## **FTB Quests Integration**
The update introduces **FTB Quests**, offering an evolving questing system designed to guide and challenge players. While quests are still being actively developed, they lay the groundwork for future updates that will further enrich the gameplay experience.

## **A New Era Awaits**
This update is packed with surprises, enhancements, and custom features that are best experienced firsthand. Whether it’s the immersive world generation, refined mod interactions, or the excitement of tackling new progression challenges, Forge Frontier 2.0 promises an unforgettable journey.

Thank you for your patience and support during these past eight months of development. I hope you enjoy this massive overhaul as much as I’ve enjoyed bringing it to life. The future of Forge Frontier is brighter than ever—your adventure begins now!
