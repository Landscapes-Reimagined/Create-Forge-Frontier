# Modpack Patch Notes: Version 1.3.0 [Pack Overhaul]
**Release Date**: March 17th, 2024

Version 1.3.0 marks a significant milestone in our development journey, representing a comprehensive enhancement of our modpack. This release concentrates on refining the overall experience through meticulous recipe adjustments, the introduction of innovative items, resolution of quest-related issues, selective mod removals, and extensive mod updates. The alterations delineated below are meticulously curated to align more closely with a Create modpack ethos, moving away from the eclectic assortment typical of Kitchen Sink packs. Our objective is to deliver a more cohesive and immersive experience, elevating your engagement and enjoyment.
