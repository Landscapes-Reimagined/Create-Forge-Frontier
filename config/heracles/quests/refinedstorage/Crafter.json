      "The Crafter is how we store patterns for our Network to know how to craft items. Once a recipe is placed into the crafter, you'll be able to \"Request\" an item to be crafted from your Grid. You can do this by hitting CTRL+Shift when clicking on the item you have a recipe for to bring up the crafting GUI.",
      "",
      "This block can also be placed facing a machine to use Processing Patterns. For example, if you point the Crafter at a Furnace, you can put a recipe inside for a recipe you need a furnace for, like smelting raw processors. As long as the crafter is attached to your system and the Furnace has an importer attached to it, the Crafter will allow you to request the smelted version of the Processor!"
