      "The Regulator Upgrade allows you to maintain a certain amount of items within a block or machine. A great example of this is telling your network that you want to keep 64 Coal within a Furnace. You'd place the upgrade in the exporter attached to the furnace, and set it to 64. Your system will then try to keep the furnace full of fuel!"
