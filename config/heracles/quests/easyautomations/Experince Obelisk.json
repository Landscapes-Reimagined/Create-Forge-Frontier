      "The Experience Obelisk is a device that lets you easily store and retrieve large amounts of XP. Every point of experience is converted into 20mB of Cognitium, which is then stored as a fluid in the Obelisk's internal reservoir. This fluid can be transferred to external tanks or elsewhere using fluid pipes from most mods.",
      "",
      "By default, each Obelisk can store 10^8 mB of Cognitium â€” which translates to just over 1072 levels. ",
      "",
      "The Obelisk also has a passive XP-vacuum function which is active by default. The Obelisk will vacuum up all experience orbs in a set radius, adding them to its internal storage. This behavior can be adjusted in the settings page.",
      "",
      "Upon right-clicking the block, you are presented with the following 6 options to store or retrieve XP. Since minecraft XP does not work in a linear fashion, with each level being worth more the higher they get, all XP values are from the players' perspective. That is to say, if you had 30 levels and chose to store 10 in an empty obelisk, you would be left with 20 levels, but the Obelisk GUI would read 24 levels - since each individual level is worth more the higher you go."
