      "The Enchantment Module brings with it a full overhaul of the Enchanting Table and the enchanting process. A wealth of new enchantments have been added, and some items that were previously unenchantable can now be enchanted (like shears).",
      "",
      "Bookshelves and other blocks now provide one or many Enchanting Stats, which contribute to how effective your enchantments will be. You'll also notice that the max level of many enchantments has been increased, and the Enchanting Table has a brand new GUI.",
      "",
      "When you enchant, there are now a number of factors to consider, instead of just the level. ",
      "- Eterna represents how strong your enchantment is, increasing the level cost. ",
      "- Quanta is a measure of randomness, changing just how much RNG is involved. ",
      "- Arcana increases the number of enchantments and makes rare enchantments more common.",
      "Stats form the basis of a much more involved enchanting system, instead of the set-and-forget enchanting tables of Vanilla.",
      "",
      "If you're wondering how you get these stats, look no further! Apotheosis adds a wealth of new bookshelves that provide these bonuses. Some other vanilla blocks, such as skulls and candles, can also be used to buff your enchantment table."
