      "Create Stuff & Additions is a mod that uses the resources of Create to offer a new set of equipment, tools and gadget! Equipments that increase your physical abilities (Your Strength or Mining Speed) but also give you new ways to move like floating, bouncing and even flying! Depending on your type of equipment (brass, andesite or copper) you will need different fuels such as steam (using water and fuel), heat energy (using fuel) or hydraulic energy (using water)! This mod also adds a lot of recipes that make certain Minecraft items (Chainmail Armor, Coral, Netherrack, Crying Obsidian and Magma Cream...) craftable with the new ways added by Create such as haunting and filling!"
