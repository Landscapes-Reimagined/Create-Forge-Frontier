      "Placement",
      "When placed by the player, the Threshold Switch will attempt to orient itself toward an adjacent inventory. If multiple or no inventories are present, the Threshold Switch may orient itself toward the player and can be adjusted as normal using the Wrench. At present, it cannot be oriented vertically.",
      "",
      "Item thresholds can be set to determine when the redstone signal turns on or off. When the Switch is first placed, it stays off until it reaches 75% inventory, then stays on until it reaches 25% inventory.",
      "",
      "The chest icon represents how full the inventory is, as well as the current signal state (on/off) depending on which lane the chest icon is in. The arrows represent inventory thresholds, illustrated by the chest icon switching lanes upon reaching the arrow.",
      "",
      "The signal can be inverted by clicking the button showing two opposing arrows next to the lower threshold bar."
