      "A Pulse Repeater is a redstone device that emits a pulse a set delay after receiving a trigger signal. It can also be set to output a redstone signal by default and to emit a negative pulse after the time delay. Right-clicking the device toggles it between positive and negative pulse outputs. Regardless of the type of pulse selected, the device is triggered on the ascending edge of a redstone signal (off to on). Additional trigger signals will be ignored until after the pulse is complete.",
      "",
      "The delay can be changed by placing the crosshairs over the center of the device and moving the scroll wheel on the mouse. Delay times can be set from 2-19 ticks, 1-59 seconds, and 1-30 minutes. Once the device is triggered and the delay is counting down, changes to the delay time will not take effect until the currently triggered pulse is done.",
      "",
      "Similar to a Redstone Repeater, a Pulse Repeater acts as a diode transmitting a signal only in one direction. It outputs a signal strength of 15 regardless of the input strength thus behaving as a circuit extender. And it can both power and draw power from opaque blocks."
