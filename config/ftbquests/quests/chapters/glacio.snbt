				"The moment your ship lands, it becomes clear‚ÄîGlacio is unlike any world you‚Äôve faced before. The landscape is an endless expanse of frozen stone and shimmering ice, with jagged peaks and frostbitten valleys stretching as far as the eye can see. The air itself bites, and the silence is broken only by the distant howl of icy winds."

				"Armed with your Tier 4 Rocket and advanced gear, you‚Äôre among the first to brave this frozen wasteland. But beneath the icy crust lies more than just frost‚ÄîFrostite, Glacio Ice Shards, and ancient, frost-covered structures hide powerful secrets and treasures."

				"Survival here demands resilience and preparation. The cold is unrelenting, the terrain unforgiving, and the guardians of Glacio‚Äôs ancient ruins will test your strength like never before."
